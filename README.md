# Human Rights and Freedom Analysis

## Analysis Purpose
This analysis aims to examine whether the Human Rights Index (HRI) and Press Freedom (PF) go hand in hand worldwide – which could indicate a correlation between the two indices – and whether the Prison Population Rate (PPR) is directly or inversely proportional to this data.

## Available Datasets
- Human Rights Index  https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-rights-index-vdem
- Press Freedom Index https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/press-freedom-fh
- Prison Population Rate https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prison-population-rate

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between the Human Rights Index, Press Freedom, and Prison Population Rate across different countries from 2000 to 2023.

## Questions to Answer
- Do the Human Rights Index, Press Freedom, and Prison Population Rate correlate strictly?
- What was/were the worst year/s for each country from 2000 to 2016? And which year(s) were the worst for the most countries?
- What is the growth or decrease percentage of Human Rights for each country from 2000 to 2016? And what is the average for Press Freedom?

## Results & Conclusion
Countries with higher Human Rights Index also have higher Press Freedom, suggesting a strong correlation between the two indices. However, the relationship with the Prison Population Rate is more complex. Despite higher or lower Human Rights Index and Press Freedom, the Prison Population Rate can significantly vary from one country to another.
Countries with higher Human Rights Index growth percentages are typically those that had a lower index in 2000. Some countries with high indices from the start have recently regressed.
